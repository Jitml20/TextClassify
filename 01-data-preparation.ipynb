       "'I own a small trucking company. One of my trucks needed a repair. I hired a mechanic to do the repair on XX/XX/XXXX. He told us he installed new batteries and a new starter on the truck. The mechanic stated his work was guaranteed and I paid him with my TD Bank XXXX credit card {$2300.00} for this repair. When my driver went to start the truck for work the next day, the truck did not work/start again. We tried calling/texting mechanic to let him know the truck was not working even though the previous day he said he fixed the truck. I have the texts and phone records showing we were reaching out to the mechanic with no response from him. I had to hire another mechanic to fix truck again and found out the parts put in my truck by the first mechanic were wrong. I filed a dispute on XX/XX/XXXX for the above transaction with my TD Bank XXXX credit card. Even though I paid the first mechanic {$2300.00}, my dispute amount was for only {$1300.00} because that amount is for the wrong parts. The credit card company requested proof of records and a second estimate for work done on truck. I overnighted a package on XX/XX/XXXX to the credit card company. Within a day or two that is when the dispute department requested a second estimate. The dispute department stated I had only until XX/XX/XXXX to submit the second estimate documentation. So I faxed the second estimate on XX/XX/XXXX which was the same date the dispute department received my overnight package. When I called to followup on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX the dispute department stated they never received second estimate needed for dispute, even though I had a fax confirmation transmission stating the fax was sent. So I sent fax again onXX/XX/XXXX ( which was the deadline for this documentation ) and received fax confirmation sheet stating the fax was sent. TD Bank XXXX credit card stated they never received second estimate in time and they closed my dispute. So even though I did everything they requested in the time they wanted because of the failure on their end with not receiving fax ( even though I have proof ), my company lost when I should be protected by the \" XXXX \\'\\' logo.'"
